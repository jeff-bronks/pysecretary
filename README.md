Simulation of the secretary problem in Python

The thought process was kicked off by https://xkcd.com/2768/ "Definition of e". I wondered how I would define e without referring to logarithms. Reading about e in Wikipedia, I found that e was the solution to the secretary problem. I didn't bother reading on to find out how this was worked out, as I'm pretty sure I couldn't follow an analytical solution if there is one, so instead I decided to use a Monte Carlo method to derive e for myself. 

Conclusion: It works but the accuracy is poor. Maybe some smoothing on the graph would help.
